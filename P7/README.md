## Spotify Wrapped
[Spotify Wrapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify_Wrapped) is a feature presenting Spotify users’ 100 most played songs from the past year. In 2021, Spotify Wrapped calculated an “[Audio Aura](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/learn-more-about-the-audio-aura-in-your-spotify-2021-wrapped-with-aura-reader-mystic-michaela/)” for each user, a “reading of their two most prominent moods as dictated by their top songs and artists of the year.” Suppose Spotify determines an audio aura by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of a person’s top 100 songs from the past year.
