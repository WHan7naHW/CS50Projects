Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs
of one listener from 2018, how would you
characterize their audio aura?

A: I would map out the name(s) of their
favorite song(s), favorite artist(s),
and the kind(s) of music they like most,
considering other features like daceability,
valence, tempo and so forth.

Q: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve
calculated this aura might not be very
representative of the listener. What
better ways of calculating this aura
would you propose?

A: This method of calculation assumes
that all 100 songs carry the same weight,
which may not reflect reality. In my
opinion, at least one additional factor
should be taken into consideration: the
total time the user listened to each song
during the year 2018.
