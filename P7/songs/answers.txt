Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs
of one listener from 2018, how would you
characterize their audio aura?

A: For this listener’s top 100 songs from
2018, the average energy, valence, and
danceability are 0.65906, 0.484443, and
0.71646 respectively.

Q: Hypothesize about why the way you’ve
calculated this aura might not be very
representative of the listener. What
better ways of calculating this aura
would you propose?

A: This method of calculation assumes
that all 100 songs carry the same weight,
which may not reflect reality. In my
opinion, at least one additional factor
should be taken into consideration: the
total time the user listened to each song
during the year 2018.
