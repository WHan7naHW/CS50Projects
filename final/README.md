- [x] a web-based application using HTML, SQL and JavaScript
- [x] a CS50's [Final Project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/project/)

#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:

  This project is a web-based application using HTML, SQL and JavaScript, displaying a music player that can play, pause, play the next song, shuffle, and delete a song from the playlist. It is also mobile-friendly.
  First, for the technical perspective, this project contains an [HTML](index.html) for content, a [CSS](styles.css) for outlook styles, and a [JavaScript](script.js) for responsive design. Each is tightly connected to ensure all the functions.
  To be detailed, the HTML uses <div> for separeting and organizing different contents. The CSS uses :root defining regular expressions for clear and consise writing. It also uses @media to define outlook on mobile screen. Then, the JavaScript uses .addEventListener and other functions to achieve responsive outcome.  
  As for its outlook, it shows the album cover art, song title, artist name, and control button on the top. Below is the playlist of the songs. For the songs playing. Considering the copyright of artists and songs, this project embeds the Spotify iframe into the webpage. Therefore, you can only preview the songs unless you were logged in Spotify (at other pages). What's more, the playlist ensures users to play next, previous, and shuffle. It also allows for scroll bar for both computer and mobile version.
  However, there're still some remained unsolved.
